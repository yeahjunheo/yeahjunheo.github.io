    <h2>Hi! I'm Yeahjun Heo</h2>

    <p>
      I'm am a 3rd-year CS at Kyoto University in Japan, but my name suggests
      that I come from the country of Kpop and kimchi - South Korea. I am
      currently based in Kyoto, Japan but this will only last till I find my
      next destination! Something interesting about me is that Japan is the
      first country I've lived for more than 5 consecutive years! Before this, I
      had stayed in Fukuoka (Japan), South Korea, Malta, Philippines, and Oman.
      With my final years of University creeping closer, I decided that it might
      be time to start leaving a record of my work before I go join the Korean
      military for two years. Since I'll be learning stuff here and there while
      I simultaneously work on updating this webpage, stay tuned to see what
      else I bring to this sandbox of mine.
